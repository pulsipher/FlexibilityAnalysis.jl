# FlexibilityAnalysis.jl

**Status**
`FlexibilityAnalysis.jl` is long out of date and is currently without a developer. It last worked with Julia `v0.6` and JuMP `v0.18` (with the old MathProgBase solver package versions). Please respond to [this issue](https://github.com/pulsipher/FlexibilityAnalysis.jl/issues/2) if you would like to help bring this up-to-date.

A JuMP extension for analyzing and quantifying the flexibility of complex systems.
Formerly known as [FlexJuMP.jl](https://github.com/pulsipher/FlexJuMP.jl).
